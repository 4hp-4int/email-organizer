I have a topic consisting of the following documents:
[DOCUMENTS]

The topic is described by the following keywords: '[KEYWORDS]'.

Generate a concise and specific label for this topic in **2-5 words**. The label must accurately represent the documents and keywords.

❌ Do **not** add any extra words.  
❌ Do **not** explain your choice.  
❌ If the topic is unclear, return **only** 'XXX'.  

Only return the label. Nothing more.
