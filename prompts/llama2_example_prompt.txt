- Subject: Your January Financial Report - Body: View your detailed financial report for January. See your spending, savings, and investment performance.
- Subject: Bill Reminder - Electricity - Body: Your electricity bill is due on February 15th. Pay online or at any authorized payment center.

The topic is described by the following keywords: 'bills, statements, financial, report, payment, credit card, electricity, due, transactions, spending'.

Generate a concise and specific label for this topic in **2-5 words**. The label must accurately represent the documents and keywords.

❌ Do **not** add any extra words.

Only return the label. Nothing more.
